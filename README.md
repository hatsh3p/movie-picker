# movie-picker

## The Problem
During early Covid, like everyone else, I watched a lot of movies that I normally would have not gotten around to.
I wanted to create a program for picking what movie to watch that night without spending a lot of time looking at movie lists.

## The Solution
1. Keep a running .csv file of movies
2. Pick three movies
3. I get to veto one, the person I'm watching with gets to veto one
4. Watch the remaining movie

## TODO
* [ ] Implement veto feature
